ðŸ“š Paper: [arXiv 2503.18671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18671)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

SAC-Pose introduces a structure-aware framework for correspondence learning that improves relative pose estimation, especially under challenging cases with occlusions or weak texture. Our method bypasses traditional feature matching and directly regresses structure-aware 3D correspondences.
